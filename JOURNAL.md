## 10/13/2025 - I worked on arranging pcb layouts  

I have been working on the pcb layouts on easyeda. kinda hard to find the perfect components for my project. I am using esp32 wroom, 0.96 oled display and butons. Routing was the biggest take.. it is not finished yet. This step is exacting because I could see the hardware about to done, and I learned more about bcb principles![Screenshot_20251013-072456.Chrome.jpg](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTkzMiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--297d1217cb71327f786b1751a75bc6643daa28f8/Screenshot_20251013-072456.Chrome.jpg)
