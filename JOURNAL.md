## 10/13/2025 7 AM - I worked on arranging pcb layouts  

I have been working on the pcb layouts on easyeda. kinda hard to find the perfect components for my project. I am using esp32 wroom, 0.96 oled display and butons. Routing was the biggest take.. it is not finished yet. This step is exacting because I could see the hardware about to done, and I learned more about bcb principles![Screenshot_20251013-072456.Chrome.jpg](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTkzMiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--297d1217cb71327f786b1751a75bc6643daa28f8/Screenshot_20251013-072456.Chrome.jpg)
  

## 10/13/2025 9 PM - Pcb creation  

This is my first time using easyeda and also take hard time to make it.. I have learned more about this.. and hardly finished routing the entire pcb.. there are some of features I want to add soon. I also had added busser and led for some indications. ![Screenshot_20251013-202230.Chrome.jpg](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjAxMywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--8feb799ab0ef3b190618e2fb13690e1fcd35eb42/Screenshot_20251013-202230.Chrome.jpg)
  

## 10/14/2025 - Reassembled the PCB  

![Screenshot_20251014-180451.Chrome.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjE5MSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--6085877a7cb9a30224e187d0f11a42d21d6e4046/Screenshot_20251014-180451.Chrome.png)
I had some errors in routing pcb and took a while to fix it. I had removed the old oled display and replaced it with different model display. And I have added type c connector to the board and added a regulator to give the esp 3.3v instead of 5v. The power supply is managed well.
